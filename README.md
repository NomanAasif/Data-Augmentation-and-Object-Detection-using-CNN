# Data Augmentation in CNN and Object Detection using Faster RCNN

- First part of this project involves implementation of data augmentation for an image with multiple operations such as shift, rotation, brightness, zoom, shear, and flip etc. 

- Second part of this project consists of implementation of a Faster RCNN model for object detection in image. Here, object detection is done on both single object image and multiple-object image.
